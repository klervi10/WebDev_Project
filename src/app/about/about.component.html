      <h2 class="mission">Our history</h2>
    </div> 
    <p class="mission-text">
      <span class="specific-font">This website was created by Louise DUMONT, Klervi MUROS-LE-ROUZIC and Jade MOUILLLOT (M1 students in e-Health, Smart Energies and IoT) at ISEN Yncrea Méditerranée in Toulon.</span>
      <span class="specific-font"> As students, preparing food and eating healthily are often incompatible due to lack of time or desire, and eating pasta with tomato sauce all the time isn't exactly pleasant. And yet we love cooking and creating new dishes while discovering new cultures. So this website is a mix of passions and we hope it will be useful to you in your next recipes!</span>
