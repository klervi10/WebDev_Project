## Project description
Our Project corresponds to a food API which helps the user to find some more information about meals and their recipes, depending on the category (beef recipes, breakfast recipes,...), the area or just on the specific research of the user in the search-bar. 
We created this website to inspire your next meals and break the monotony of everyday dining. Thanks to Globe Taste Adventures, discover a variety of recipes from around the world, ranging from simple to sophisticated!

We wanted to create this type of site to give you inspiration for your next meals and avoid eating the same thing over and over again! You can browse our site easily and find what you're looking for.

### In the “Home” button : presentation of all the recipes
Here you can see lots of recipes for your next meal, you can browse freely on this page or if you are looking for something in particular, type in the search-bar “Burek” for example. 
As you type, the meals on offer are filtered according to your input.

### In “Category” : list of all categories of meals
Same thing as the home button, you can navigate through this page anc click on the grey buttons (for example to see all the beef recipes) and then being redirected to a page with all of the specific recipes from a specific category (if Beef recipes is selected, the meals “Moussaka”, “Burek”, “Bistek”,... every meal with beef will be proposed).
Or, you can search for a specific recipe in the search-bar and the output will be filtered according to your input.
For each meal which are displayed on this second page, you can click on the button "See the recipe of ... meals", to see its ingredients, measures and its recipe.

### In “Area” : list of all country recipes
Same thing as the home button or category button, you can navigate through the page and find some meals related to a specific country (for example see all American recipes) and then being redirected to a page with all of the specific meals from the specific country selected (if American is selected, Big Mac and Pancakes are proposed).
For each meal which are displayed on this second page, you can click on the button "See the recipe of ... meals", to see its ingredients, measures and its recipe.

### In “About us” : 
Here you can see all of the information about us, our mission, our story and the context of the creation of our website and finally our contacts with e-mail addresses and social media.


## How to use it
The aim of our project is to have a functional Website which allows the user to : 
- search for a meal depending on its category and its area (whether on the page or by searching for it in the search-bar) or an ingredient in the search-bar and have an output which corresponds to the wanted input
- under this bar the user can see the total amount of categories and areas which are available
- select a specific area or category and after clicking on the wanted button, all the selected meals appear with their image, for which we can click on a button (there are one button per meal), to see its image, its ingredients, their measures and the instructions for its recipe.
